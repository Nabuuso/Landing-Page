      <span><h1>Akan Naming in Ghana Culture</h1></span>
      <p>Akan names come from a traditional naming system 
      people from countries such as Togo, <br> Ivory Coast and Ghana. 
      A child’s name is determined by factors surrounding his or her birth. 
      <br> example, the day of their birth or the manner in which they were born 
      may determine which name they get <br> irrespective of their gender. 
      These Akan names signify the day one is born. <br> According to Akan tradition, 
      each child is born with a name associated to their soul. 
      <br>The day the child is born is therefore determined by the soul. <br> 
      The well thought and organized naming system <br>
      of the Akan’s was initiated 
      by the ancestors and has attracted <br>so many people’s attention 
      as they desire to know more about these names. <br>As a matter of fact, 
      it is possible to tell what led to someone’s birth, 
      <br>the day they were born and their rank among 
      the siblings just by their names. <br>
      This is why you need to read this <br>article to know more about Akan 
      names and their meanings.</p>
